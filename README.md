# Pandas-Matplotlib-Analysis
# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Overview ðŸ“Š

This project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization assignment that demonstrates fundamental skills in using the **pandas** and **matplotlib** libraries. The goal is to load, clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset to uncover insights and patterns.

The project fulfills the following objectives:
* Loading and exploring a dataset using pandas.
* Performing basic statistical analysis and data cleaning.
* Creating a variety of plots and charts with matplotlib to visualize key findings.

## Dataset

This project uses a sample dataset that mimics the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset for classification problems. The dataset contains information about various measurements of different iris flower species.

## Files in this Repository

* `data_analysis.py`: The main Python script containing all the code for data loading, analysis, and visualization.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## How to Run the Project ðŸš€

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis-Project.git](https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis-Project.git)
    cd Data-Analysis-Project
    ```

2.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    Make sure you have `pandas` and `matplotlib` installed. If not, you can install them using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
    ```

3.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the Python script from your terminal. This will perform the analysis and display the generated plots.
    ```bash
    python data_analysis.py
    ```

## Analysis and Findings ðŸ“ˆ

The script performs the following key analyses:

* **Data Exploration**: Checks for missing values and data types. Missing numerical values are filled with the mean of their respective columns.
* **Descriptive Statistics**: Computes the mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistics for numerical columns to summarize the data.
* **Grouped Analysis**: Calculates the average `sepal_length` and `petal_length` for each species, revealing significant differences between the groups.

## Visualizations

The script generates four plots to visualize the data:

1.  **Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between `sepal_length` and `petal_length`, which clearly separates the species. 
2.  **Bar Chart**: Compares the average `petal_length` across different species.
3.  **Histogram**: Illustrates the distribution of `sepal_width` values.
4.  **Line Chart**: Shows a trend of `sepal_length` over a dummy time-series, demonstrating how to plot data over time.

Feel free to explore the `data_analysis.py` file to see the code in detail. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
